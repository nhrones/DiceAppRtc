//  ViewElement objects are used to persist renderable objects to the 'canvas'.       \\
//                                                                                    \\
//  ViewElements are held in an ES6 Map.                                              \\
//  This map maintains a sort-order based on an ViewElements zOrder number.           \\
//  This insures proper rendering order, as well as, ordered 'hit-testing'            \\
//  by using each elements Path2D path.                                               \\
//  We hit-test 'front-to-back' to insure that top-level elements are detected first. \\
//  When an element is added or moved, its zOrder value is mutated to indicate        \\
//  in which order(zOrder) it is rendered in.                                         \\
